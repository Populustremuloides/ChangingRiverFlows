Loss = $\sum_i \sum_j |Cov_{ij}(Imputed) - Cov_{ij}(Raw)| + \sum_i \sum_j |Corr_{ij}(Imputed) - Corr_{ij}(Raw)|$
data were transformed to have mean zero and standard deviation of 1 prior to imputation.
imputed values were initialized to the distribution mean.
final loss: 415.16968565904995
percent Nan initially (included previuosly imputed data) was: 2.8973695413501828
